# App transcription

`POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` retains the SDK's encrypted JSON request and
`text` response contract. It requires a user JWT and a paid-plan entitlement for
both registered and guest users. API keys are rejected. Transcription is included
in the plan: remaining chat credits do not control access and this route publishes
no token-usage debit event.

OpenSecret sends the whole recording to the configured attested Continuum proxy
using `whisper-large-v3`. There is no enclave provider fallback, chunk splitting,
text stitching, or automatic POST replay. The proxy continues to own its existing
attestation, encryption, and transport recovery; one enclave send is not an
end-to-end exactly-once execution guarantee.

## Bounds and validation

- Maximum decoded upload: 39,000,000 bytes; maximum recording: 20 minutes.
- WAV input is validated from RIFF chunks, PCM/float format, consistent frame
  sizes and rates, and the actual data length before a provider request.
- Exact digital silence in validated WAV is rejected before sending. There is no
  volume threshold: even one nonzero PCM bit remains eligible, so quiet speech
  is not filtered out.
- Supported compressed containers remain bounded passthrough inputs. Their
  decoding and duration are provider-owned; an over-duration response is rejected
  after processing and may already have incurred provider cost.
- At most one active transcription per user and four per backend process. There
  is no unbounded waiting queue. Cancellation releases admission.
- Billing lookup has a five-second deadline and fails closed when unavailable.
- The complete provider send and response read share a 120-second deadline.
  Responses are limited to 1 MiB and require a nonempty text string and validated
  duration evidence. Known WAV durations must agree within one second for rounding.
- Missing or malformed text, empty transcription, inconsistent duration,
  oversized response, provider failure, and timeout have stable sanitized errors.
  An empty response is not a successful transcript.

The provider/model, audio size, duration, elapsed time, and returned billed seconds
(when supplied) are safe operational metadata. Audio, transcripts, filenames,
prompts, credentials, and arbitrary provider diagnostics must not enter logs.

## Existing-client limits

The app records 16 kHz mono PCM16 WAV. Ten minutes is about 19.2 MB of audio;
twenty minutes is about 38.4 MB. Both fit the SDK's 50 MiB Transport V2 JSON-body
limit after base64 encoding. Thirty minutes is about 57.6 MB of audio and 76.8 MB
of base64, so the existing SDK rejects it before upload. Enclave-side compression
or splitting cannot change that ingress limit. Transport V1's additional base64
envelope is more restrictive.

Provider duration agreement confirms reported audio processing, not transcript
accuracy or completeness of recognized speech. Use the real-audio validation
harness with ordered beginning, middle, and end anchors to check those properties.
See [transcription validation](transcription-validation.md).

Local API/provider tests do not establish hosted edge timeouts, Nitro/PCR identity,
or recovery after app closure or loss of the downstream response. Validate the
actual hosted request deadline separately before rollout; increasing the enclave
timeout alone does not increase an upstream gateway's deadline.
