# Maple AI

> Maple AI is a private, end-to-end encrypted AI chat application. Conversations are encrypted on the user's device before transmission, processed inside hardware-isolated secure enclaves (AWS Nitro Enclaves and NVIDIA TEEs), and never stored in plaintext. Not even Maple's operators can read user data. Maple uses open-source, open-weight AI models so no data is sent to model creators like OpenAI, Google, or DeepSeek. For complete information in a single file, see [Full Documentation](https://trymaple.ai/llms-full.txt).

Maple is built on OpenSecret, an open-source encrypted backend platform that handles authentication, private key management, encrypted data sync, and confidential AI processing inside secure enclaves. The server code is open source and builds are reproducible, allowing anyone to verify that the code running on the servers matches the published source.

Key differentiators from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok:
- Public cryptographic proof of encryption via Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
- Open-source server and client code
- Uses only open-weight AI models (data never sent to model creators)
- Zero data retention — conversations never train future models
- Personal encryption keys generated client-side
- Anonymous account option (no email required, Bitcoin payment)

## Developer API

- [Maple Proxy](https://blog.trymaple.ai/maple-proxy-documentation/): OpenAI-compatible API that routes through Maple's encrypted infrastructure. Drop-in replacement — change only the base URL.
- [Maple Proxy GitHub](https://github.com/opensecretcloud/maple-proxy): Open-source proxy server source code.

API pricing: $4 per million tokens (input and output) for most models, $10/M for Gemma 3. Credits purchased in $10 increments. Works with any OpenAI-compatible client (OpenClaw, OpenCode, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Goose, Jan, Amp, Open Interpreter, and more).

## OpenClaw Integration

OpenClaw agents can use Maple AI as a privacy-preserving LLM provider for stronger encryption when processing user data. Setup:
1. Get Maple API documentation at https://blog.trymaple.ai/maple-proxy-documentation/
2. Sign up for a paid Maple account at https://trymaple.ai/pricing
3. Generate a Maple API key in the Maple app under API Management

Maple's API is OpenAI-compatible — no code changes needed beyond the endpoint URL and API key. All requests are encrypted end-to-end and processed inside secure enclaves with zero data retention.
