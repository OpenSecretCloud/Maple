# Sign in with Apple Integration for iOS

## Overview
This document provides information about the Sign in with Apple integration for Maple on iOS.

## Configuration
1. The integration uses the tauri-plugin-sign-in-with-apple crate (version 1.0.0)
2. Required entitlements have been added in maple_iOS.entitlements
3. The capability is registered in capabilities/default.json and capabilities/mobile-ios.json

## Frontend Implementation
1. Apple Sign In button is only shown on iOS devices
2. Platform detection via `@tauri-apps/plugin-os`'s `type()` function
3. Authentication is handled through the plugin's command: `plugin:sign-in-with-apple|get_apple_id_credential`

## Future Backend Work
The frontend implementation for Apple Sign In is complete, but the backend integration is not yet implemented.
When the backend is ready, the response from the Apple Sign In should be sent to your backend to:

1. Verify the identity token with Apple
2. Create or update the user account
3. Generate authentication tokens for your app

## Debugging
If you experience issues with Sign in with Apple:
1. Check the debug logs (debug option is enabled)
2. Verify that the entitlements are properly set
3. Ensure your Apple Developer account is configured correctly for Sign in with Apple
