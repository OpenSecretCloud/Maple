              who creates the Team account (the "Team Administrator") accepts these Terms on behalf
              of the Team and is responsible for all activity under the Team account. The Team

              <strong>11.2. Dispute Resolution.</strong> Please read the following arbitration
              agreement in this Section (the "Arbitration Agreement") carefully. It requires you to
              arbitrate disputes with Company, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates,
              successors and assigns and all of their respective officers, directors, employees,
              agents, and representatives (collectively, the "Company Parties") and limits the
              manner in which you can seek relief from the Company Parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> You agree that any
              dispute between you and any of the Company Parties relating in any way to the
              Products, the services offered on the Products (the "Services") or these Terms will be
              resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and the
              Company Parties may assert individualized claims in small claims court if the claims
              qualify, remain in such court and advance solely on an individual, non-class basis;
              and (2) you or the Company Parties may seek equitable relief in court for infringement
              or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress,
              domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement
              shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms and shall apply, without
              limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before you agreed to these Terms
              (in accordance with the preamble) or any prior version of these Terms. This
              Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of
              federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
              against the Company Parties on your behalf. For purposes of this Arbitration
              Agreement, "Dispute" will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring
              before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims
              that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(b) Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> There might be instances when a
              Dispute arises between you and Company. If that occurs, Company is committed to
              working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Company agree that good
              faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low-cost and
              mutually beneficial outcome. You and Company therefore agree that before either party
              commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court
              if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via
              videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by
              this Arbitration Agreement ("Informal Dispute Resolution Conference"). If you are
              represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will
              also participate in the conference.
            </p>
            <p>
              The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its
              intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference ("Notice"), which shall
              occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension
              is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Company that you intend to initiate
              an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to:{" "}
              <a href="mailto:support@trymaple.ai">support@trymaple.ai</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a
              separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if
              the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases,
              unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate
              in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the
              time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution
              Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from
              engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party's Dispute.
              Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and
              requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of
              limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in
              the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(c) Arbitration Rules and Forum.</strong> These Terms evidence a transaction
              involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with
              respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1
              et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement
              and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described
              above does not resolve satisfactorily within 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you
              and Company agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the
              Dispute through binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
              interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration will be
              conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes
              involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not
              inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS' most current
              version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at{" "}

              </a>

              800-352-5267. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party
              with a request for arbitration (the "Request"). The Request must include: (1) the
              name, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address of the party seeking
              arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address
              associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being
              asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought
              and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States
              Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution
              process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any
              necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also
              include counsel's name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such
              counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the
              best of counsel's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
              reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for
              any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly
              increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal
              contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending,
              modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual
              and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified,
              will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further
              investigation or discovery.

              Unless you and Company otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in
              Subsection 11.2(h) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where
              you reside. Subject to the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and
              reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited
              nature of the arbitration. If the JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will
              select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS fees and
              costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable JAMS Rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and Company agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the
              arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone
              except the parties' attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to
              the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the
              arbitration proceedings confidential.
            </p>

              <strong>(d) Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator shall have exclusive
              authority to resolve all disputes subject to arbitration hereunder including, without
              limitation, any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability
              or formation of this Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration
              Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to
              the subsection entitled "Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief,"
              including any claim that all or part of the subsection entitled "Waiver of Class or
              Other Non-Individualized Relief" is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that
              such subsection entitled "Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief" has been
              breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
              arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the subsection entitled "Batch
              Arbitration," all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only
              by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about
              whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be
              decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4)
              all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided
              only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration
              proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other
              cases or parties, except as expressly provided in the subsection entitled "Batch
              Arbitration." The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of
              all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
              monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
              individual party under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and these Terms
              (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
              statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any
              award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any
              damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The award of the
              arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may
              be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(e) Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong>{" "}
              <strong>
                Except as specified in Section 11.2(a) you and the Company Parties hereby waive any
                constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a
                judge or a jury.
              </strong>{" "}
              You and the Company Parties are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes
              shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except
              as specified in Section 11.2(a) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis
              the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would.
              However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
              award is subject to very limited review.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(f) Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong>{" "}
              <strong>
                You and Company agree that, except as specified in subsection 11.2(h), each of us
                may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not on a class,
                representative, or collective basis, and the parties hereby waive all rights to have
                any dispute be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class,
                collective, representative, or mass action basis. Only individual relief is
                available, and disputes of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or
                consolidated with those of any other customer or user.
              </strong>{" "}
              Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or
              injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the
              extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim. Nothing
              in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under
              the Subsection 11.2(h) entitled "Batch Arbitration." Notwithstanding anything to the
              contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final
              decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this
              subsection, "Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief," are invalid or
              unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for
              public injunctive relief), you and Company agree that that particular claim or request
              for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed
              from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in
              the State of Delaware. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small
              claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Company from participating in a
              class-wide settlement of claims.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(g) Attorneys' Fees and Costs.</strong> The parties shall bear their own
              attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the
              substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was
              brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal
              Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Company need to invoke the authority of a
              court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an
              order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the
              other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys'
              fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any
              court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to
              arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution Process, is entitled to recover
              their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees and
              costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(h) Batch Arbitration.</strong> To increase the efficiency of administration
              and resolution of arbitrations, you and Company agree that in the event that there are
              100 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against
              Company by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or
              organizations, within a 30 day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the JAMS
              shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch
              (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching
              described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one
              arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a
              single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per
              side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be
              determined by the arbitrator, and one final award ("Batch Arbitration").
            </p>
            <p>
              All parties agree that Requests are of a "substantially similar nature" if they arise
              out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar
              legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree
              on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall
              advise the JAMS, and the JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine
              the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process ("Administrative Arbitrator"). In
              an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator,
              the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are
              necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator's fees shall
              be paid by Company.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and Company agree to cooperate in good faith with the JAMS to implement the Batch
              Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for
              batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of
              arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to
              assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of
              an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a
              class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration
              involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly
              set forth in this provision.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(i) 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the
              provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written notice of your
              decision to opt out to the following email:{" "}
              <a href="mailto:support@trymaple.ai">support@trymaple.ai</a>, within 30 days after
              first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your
              name and address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration
              Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these
              Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no
              effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us, or may
              enter into in the future with us.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>(j) Invalidity, Expiration.</strong> Except as provided in the subsection
              entitled "Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief", if any part or parts of
              this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable,
              then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed
              and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and
              effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Company as detailed in
              this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable
              statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time
              barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to
              such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the
              applicable court of competent jurisdiction.

              <strong>11.3. Export.</strong> The Products may be subject to U.S. export control laws
              and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not
              to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data
              acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United

              <strong>11.4. Electronic Communications.</strong> The communications between you and
              Company use electronic means, whether you use the Products or send us emails, or
              whether Company posts notices on the Products or communicates with you via email. For
              contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an
              electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices,
              disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically
              satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were in
              writing in hard copy. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>11.5. Entire Terms.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement
              between you and us regarding the use of the Products. Our failure to exercise or
              enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such
              right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and
              have no legal or contractual effect. The word "including" means "including without
              limitation". If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or
              unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid
              or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable
              to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an
              independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These
              Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted,
              delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company's prior written consent,
              and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the
              foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms. The terms and
              conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.
