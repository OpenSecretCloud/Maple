# Maple SDKs

This directory contains the TypeScript/React and Rust clients used by Maple and
internal OpenSecret applications. Both clients establish attested,
end-to-end encrypted sessions with an OpenSecret backend and expose the API
surface needed by those applications.

The developer/platform API remains part of the TypeScript SDK for internal
OpenSecret workflows. This repository does not maintain or deploy a separate
documentation website; keep behavior documentation close to the exported code
and tests.

## Repository layout

- `src/` — `@mapleai/sdk`, including the React providers, encrypted API
  client, attestation policy, model/conversation APIs, and internal developer
  platform client.
- `rust/` — the `maple-sdk` crate, imported as `maple_sdk` by native clients.
- `docs/PLATFORM.md` — internal developer/platform API notes.
- repository-root `.github/workflows/sdk-*.yml` — path-scoped TypeScript, Rust,
  and supply-chain validation for this directory.

Maple's frontend consumes this TypeScript package through `file:../../../sdk`.
Desktop Maple and `proxy/` consume `sdk/rust` through versioned path
dependencies; iOS and Android exclude those desktop-only Rust consumers.
Published npm and crates.io packages remain independently versioned.

## Package identity migration

The new package names are `@mapleai/sdk` and `maple-sdk`. This source change
retains TypeScript version 3.5.2 and Rust version 3.6.2; first publication and
registry ownership are separate steps. Until those packages are published,
develop against the in-tree dependencies above. The registry installation
examples below describe the new package identities after publication.

The rename preserves the exported API, including `OpenSecretProvider`,
`useOpenSecret`, `OpenSecretDeveloper` and `OpenSecretClient`. OpenSecret remains
the backend name. Backend URLs, configuration variables, signed-PCR verification
and encrypted transport retain their existing contracts. Existing published
`@opensecret/react` and `opensecret` packages remain available to older consumers.

## Security model

For non-local endpoints, both SDKs require HTTPS, verify AWS Nitro attestation,
and enforce an environment-scoped PCR0 trust policy before completing key
exchange. The SDKs bundle environment-specific PCR0 trust roots and the
verification key used to authenticate signed remote history entries.

Mock attestation is limited to exact loopback development endpoints (plus the
documented Android emulator alias in the Rust SDK). Do not weaken attestation,
PCR0 validation, or encrypted transport to accommodate a caller.

The SDKs use operating-system or Web Crypto randomness for keys, nonces, and
session material. Never substitute deterministic or convenience randomness in
production paths.

## TypeScript/React SDK

Install the package:

```sh
bun add @mapleai/sdk
```

Wrap the application with `OpenSecretProvider` and supply the backend URL and
client ID:

```tsx
import { OpenSecretProvider } from "@mapleai/sdk";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

export function AppProviders({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <OpenSecretProvider
      apiUrl="https://api.example.com"
      clientId="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      pcrConfig={{ environment: "production" }}
    >
      {children}
    </OpenSecretProvider>
  );
}
```

Use `useOpenSecret` for authentication, encrypted application APIs,
conversations, inference, and account operations. Internal developer tooling
uses `OpenSecretDeveloper` and `useOpenSecretDeveloper`; preserve that surface
when changing the public exports.

### Development

Use the pinned Nix shell and Bun version. `bun.lock` is the supported dependency
lockfile; repository installation and updates use Bun. npm is used only to
publish the built tarball, so do not create an npm lockfile.

```sh
nix develop --no-update-lock-file
bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
bun run format:check
bun run build
bun test --timeout 30000
```

Integration tests read the variables documented in `.env.example`. Monorepo
[`sdk-integration.yml`](../.github/workflows/sdk-integration.yml) migrates
disposable PostgreSQL, starts the in-tree `services/opensecret/` backend from
the same checkout on loopback, and creates disposable SDK fixtures. It does
not depend on the hosted development service or stored test-account credentials.

Tests that spend model/provider capacity are opt-in with `RUN_LIVE_AI=1` and
are not part of the deterministic pull-request gate. Backend contract changes
and SDK changes are validated together against that checkout; released clients
and independently deployed backend versions still need compatibility review.
Both SDKs fetch their selected environment's signed PCR history from
`MaplePrivacyLabs/Maple/master/services/opensecret/`: `pcrProdHistory.json` for
production and `pcrDevHistory.json` for development. The existing verification
key, embedded roots, custom history URL overrides, and redirect rejection are
unchanged. Older published SDKs and installed clients still use the legacy
`OpenSecretCloud/opensecret` URLs, which remain a manual compatibility mirror.
Changing source defaults does not update those clients or publish an SDK. See
the [backend compatibility procedure](../services/opensecret/docs/pcr-compatibility.md).

Inspect the publishable npm artifact with:

```sh
bun run pack
```

Only `dist/` is included in the package.

Publish a freshly built npm artifact with:

```sh
just publish-npm
```

## Rust SDK

Add the crate to a Rust application:

```toml
[dependencies]
maple-sdk = "3.6.2"
```

Import the primary entry point with `use maple_sdk::OpenSecretClient`.
See `rust/README.md` for native
client examples and transport details.

Run the Rust validation from the `sdk/` directory:

```sh
nix develop --no-update-lock-file -c bash -lc '
  set -euo pipefail
  cd rust
  cargo fmt --all -- --check
  cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  cargo test --locked --all-features
  cargo doc --locked --no-deps --all-features
'
```

Integration tests use the variables documented in `rust/.env.example` and are
separate from the default local validation path.

Publish the locked Rust crate with:

```sh
just publish-cargo
```

## Change discipline

- Keep the TypeScript and Rust attestation policies aligned intentionally;
  neither SDK's passing tests prove parity with the other.
- Treat API compatibility, authentication state, encrypted retry behavior, and
  PCR policy changes as security-sensitive.
- Update source comments and focused tests with behavior changes instead of
  regenerating a standalone documentation site.
- Validate the built npm package and Rust crate boundary before publishing a
  release.
