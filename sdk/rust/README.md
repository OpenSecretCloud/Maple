# OpenSecret Rust SDK

This source lives under Maple's `sdk/rust/` directory. Desktop Maple and
Maple's in-tree `proxy/` consume it through versioned path dependencies, while
crates.io publishing remains an independent compatibility surface.

Rust SDK for OpenSecret - secure AI API interactions with nitro attestation.

## Features

- 🔐 **Nitro Attestation**: Verify server identity through AWS Nitro Enclaves
- 🔑 **End-to-End Encryption**: All API calls encrypted with session keys
- 👤 **Authentication**: Support for both email-based and guest users
- 🔄 **Token Management**: Proactive, coalesced refresh
- ↔️ **Lossless Inference Transport**: Provider-specific request and response fields pass through as raw bytes
- 🛡️ **Secure by Default**: No plaintext data transmission

## Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
opensecret = "3.6.2"
bytes = "1"
futures = "0.3"
http = "1"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use opensecret::{OpenSecretClient, Pcr0Environment, Pcr0TrustPolicy, Result};
use uuid::Uuid;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize client
    let client = OpenSecretClient::new("https://api.opensecret.com")?;
    let client_id = Uuid::parse_str("your-client-id")?;

    // Establish secure session
    client.perform_attestation_handshake().await?;

    // Register and login
    let response = client.register(
        "user@example.com".to_string(),
        "password".to_string(),
        client_id,
        Some("John Doe".to_string())
    ).await?;

    println!("Logged in as: {}", response.id);
    Ok(())
}
```

Production clients verify both the AWS Nitro attestation and the enclave's
PCR0 deployment identity. `OpenSecretClient::new` uses pinned official PCR0
values and OpenSecret's signed production history. Development trust must be
selected explicitly and checks only the development roots and signed history:

```rust
let development_client = OpenSecretClient::new_with_pcr0_environment(
    "https://enclave.secretgpt.ai",
    Pcr0Environment::Development,
)?;
```

The API-key equivalent is
`OpenSecretClient::new_with_api_key_and_pcr0_environment`. A signed PCR0 added
to the selected GitHub history is accepted without a client update. Neither
official policy falls back to the other environment.

Custom deployments can add a static allowlist without replacing the selected
official trust policy:

```rust
let policy = Pcr0TrustPolicy::official().with_additional_pcr0s([
    "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
])?;
let client = OpenSecretClient::new_with_pcr0_trust_policy(
    "https://api.opensecret.cloud",
    policy,
)?;
```

Use `Pcr0TrustPolicy::from_static_allowlist(...)` to disable remote history and
trust only an explicit custom set. Remote entries are size/time bounded and
must verify against the SDK's hardcoded OpenSecret P-384 signing key. Exact
`http://` localhost and loopback development endpoints use mock attestation;
Android also supports the exact emulator alias `10.0.2.2`. Other endpoints
must use HTTPS.

## Inference APIs

`send_inference_request` is the lossless inference API. The caller owns the
HTTP method, route, query, headers, body bytes, and response parsing; the SDK
owns attestation, authentication, encryption, and response decryption. It does
not parse or rewrite inference parameters such as `stream`. Its only automatic
resend is the bounded session recovery described below:

```rust
use bytes::Bytes;
use futures::StreamExt;
use http::Request;

let request = Request::post("/v1/chat/completions")
    .header("x-provider-option", "value")
    .body(Bytes::from_static(br#"{
        "model": "provider-model",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
        "provider_option": {"enabled": true}
    }"#))
    .expect("valid inference request");

let response = client.send_inference_request(request).await?;
let status = response.status();
let mut body = response.into_body();
while let Some(chunk) = body.next().await {
    let decrypted_bytes = chunk?;
    // Parse or forward the bytes in the calling application.
}
```

The transport accepts only the SDK's explicitly allowed inference routes;
it cannot be used to bypass JWT-only account or conversation APIs. The existing
typed model, embedding, and chat-completion helpers remain available as
compatibility wrappers over the same transport.

The SDK manages transport credentials and framing. Caller-provided `Host`,
`Authorization`, cookies, `x-session-id`, `Forwarded`, `Via`,
`X-Forwarded-*`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Encoding`, `Accept-Encoding`,
`Content-MD5`, `Digest`, hop-by-hop, and `Connection`-listed headers are not
forwarded. Logical `Content-Type` and other end-to-end headers are preserved,
including multipart boundaries.

API keys can also be supplied per request with
`send_inference_request_with_api_key`. The key is encrypted inside that one
logical request and is not installed as mutable client state.

### Session recovery and retry limits

Managed requests, including inference and mutations, permit one resend after a
fresh, verified attestation handshake only on outer HTTP `400` with exactly
`x-opensecret-error-contract: 1` and `x-opensecret-error-code` equal to
`session_not_found` or `request_decryption_failed`. The server marks only an
actually missing/expired session or incoming-request AEAD authentication
failure before dispatch. The resend uses a new session and request ID.

This is V1-equivalent best-effort recovery: an intermediary can forge these
unauthenticated hints after the original operation executed. The new session's
replay set cannot prevent duplicate execution across sessions; operations that
need at-most-once execution require application-level idempotency.

Client-side response decryption/framing failures, network failures, timeouts,
partial streams, redirects, generic `400`/`503`, and application errors are not
automatically retried. Prepared native handoffs and session-bound OAuth
callbacks require a new flow instead of recovery under a new session. There is
no V1 fallback or plaintext credential resend. Proactive token refresh is
separate; an expired-access response can refresh future credentials without
resending the failed operation.

## Provider cache continuity

Transport V2 uses a random 32-byte client secret to namespace provider cache
entries. The default is random for each `OpenSecretClient`. Applications that
need cache hits across restarts should generate a root once, store it as a
secret, and restore it when constructing the client:

```rust
use opensecret::TransportV2CacheNamespaceRoot;

let root = TransportV2CacheNamespaceRoot::generate()?;
let persisted = root.to_base64();

let restored = TransportV2CacheNamespaceRoot::from_base64(&persisted)?;
let client = OpenSecretClient::new("https://api.opensecret.com")?
    .with_cache_namespace_root(restored);
```

Do not derive this root from a user identifier or credential, and do not log
it. The type redacts `Debug` output and zeroizes its bytes on drop.

## Authentication

### User Registration

Register with email:
```rust
let response = client.register(
    email,
    password,
    client_id,
    Some(name)  // Optional
).await?;
```

Register as guest (no email):
```rust
let response = client.register_guest(
    password,
    client_id
).await?;
```

### Login

Login with email:
```rust
let response = client.login(
    email,
    password,
    client_id
).await?;
```

Login with user ID (guests only):
```rust
let response = client.login_with_id(
    user_id,
    password,
    client_id
).await?;
```

### OAuth callbacks

Transport V2 binds an OAuth attempt to the attested session that initiated it.
Call `initiate_github_auth`, `initiate_google_auth`, or `initiate_apple_auth`
and the matching `handle_*_callback` method on the same live
`OpenSecretClient`. Reconstructing the client between those calls establishes
a different session and intentionally cannot redeem the original attempt.
Native applications should use OpenSecret's native handoff flow rather than
trying to export transport keys.

### Token Management

Tokens are automatically stored after login/registration. You can:

```rust
// Get one coherent access/refresh pair snapshot
let tokens = client.get_tokens()?;

// Individual reads remain available when a coherent pair is not required
let access_token = client.get_access_token()?;
let refresh_token = client.get_refresh_token()?;

// Refresh tokens
client.refresh_token().await?;

// Logout (clears credentials; the identity-neutral crypto session is reusable)
client.logout().await?;
```

## Session Management

Every API call uses an encrypted Transport V2 session:

1. **Attestation Handshake**: Establishes trust and exchanges encryption keys
2. **Encrypted Communication**: The entire logical request, including its
   credential, travels inside one authenticated envelope
3. **Token Authentication**: Protected endpoints require a valid credential in
   each encrypted request

```rust
// Optional eager setup; API calls also establish a session lazily.
client.perform_attestation_handshake().await?;

// Check session status
if let Some(session_id) = client.get_session_id()? {
    println!("Active session: {}", session_id);
}
```

The crypto session is not bound to one user or API key. Token changes and
logout therefore do not rotate it. Before a JWT-authenticated call, the SDK
uses the token's untrusted `exp` claim only as a timing hint and coalesces a
refresh when it is within 30 seconds of expiry. A refresh failure prevents that
new call from being sent. Transient, outer-transport, or AEAD failures preserve
stored credentials; only an authenticated 401 or 403 from the refresh request
clears them. Token refresh does not resend an operation that was already sent,
and ambiguous network or response-authentication failures do not trigger a
resend. The sole exception is the one fresh-session resend on an exact marked
outer `400` described in [Session recovery and retry limits](#session-recovery-and-retry-limits);
reattestation alone is not permission to replay a request.

## Error Handling

The SDK uses a custom `Error` type with detailed error variants:

```rust
use opensecret::Error;

match client.login(email, password, client_id).await {
    Ok(response) => println!("Success!"),
    Err(Error::Authentication(msg)) => println!("Auth failed: {}", msg),
    Err(Error::Api { status, message }) => println!("API error {}: {}", status, message),
    Err(e) => println!("Other error: {}", e),
}
```

## Testing

The SDK reads configuration from `.env.local` in the parent Maple `sdk/`
directory, matching the TypeScript SDK setup.

Required environment variables in `.env.local`:
```bash
VITE_OPEN_SECRET_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_OPEN_SECRET_PCR_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_TEST_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-uuid
```

Production is the default when `VITE_OPEN_SECRET_PCR_ENVIRONMENT` is omitted.
Set it to `development` when the configured URL is a hosted development enclave.

Run tests:
```bash
# All tests (requires running server on localhost:3000)
cargo test --locked

# With output
cargo test --locked -- --nocapture

# Specific test
cargo test --locked test_login_signup_flow -- --nocapture
```

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for complete examples:

```bash
# Basic authentication flow
cargo run --locked --example auth_example
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Always verify attestation** in production environments
2. **Store tokens securely** - the SDK keeps them in memory only
3. **Use HTTPS** for all production API calls
4. **Rotate tokens regularly** using the refresh mechanism
5. **Clear credentials** after use with `logout()`; the identity-neutral
   transport session may remain available for later anonymous use
